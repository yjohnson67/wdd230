            <img src="images/FHMuseum.png" alt="Frans Hall Museum">
        <p>It is a challenge for this museum to show all of the artwork that is has on one website, however with this being said it is a great museum for visitors as they will understand what they see depending on whey they visit, as well as a taste of what this museum has in store for the future months.  It shows there are two museums in one location, the art that is currently displayed as well as at the  bottom where the two locations are located.</p>

            <p>This website makes great use of their space as it is filled with seamless animations, drop shadows, and abstract elements that make images appear 3D.  This location serves as a hub for all things visual and creative.  Music and podcasts gives listeners a look into who, what, why, and how of what makes the app so sensational.  It is well laid out with a lot of space between things making it very clear what it has to offer.</p>
